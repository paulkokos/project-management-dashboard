## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. We expect all participants in the Project Management Dashboard community to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all interactions—whether online or in person—including but not limited to GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other channels.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Being Respectful**: Use welcoming and inclusive language. Respect differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- **Being Constructive**: Provide thoughtful, constructive feedback and criticism. Focus on the work, not the person.
- **Being Collaborative**: Work together to resolve conflicts and disagreements. Listen actively to understand others' perspectives.
- **Being Professional**: Maintain a professional tone in all communications. Avoid personal attacks or inflammatory language.
- **Being Inclusive**: Welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. Create an environment where everyone feels valued.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, bullying, or intimidation of any kind
- Discriminatory language or behavior based on protected characteristics
- Sexual or abusive language, imagery, or unwanted advances
- Trolling, deliberate disruption, or bad-faith arguments
- Sharing of personal information without consent
- Any form of spam or commercial solicitation
- Threats of violence or violent language

## Reporting Violations

If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the maintainers:

- Create a private discussion if available on GitHub
- Email the project maintainers directly
- Contact a core team member via an appropriate channel

All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled with confidentiality. We are committed to protecting the privacy and safety of all reporters.

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in:

- Warnings or requests to cease the behavior
- Temporary or permanent removal from the community
- Banning from contributing to the project
- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the project maintainers

The goal is to maintain a healthy, respectful community while giving individuals an opportunity to improve.
