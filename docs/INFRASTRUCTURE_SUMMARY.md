## Architecture Decisions

1. **Soft Delete over Hard Delete**: Allows data recovery and maintains referential integrity
2. **ETag-based Concurrency**: Optimistic locking without database locks
3. **Event-based Activity**: Loosely coupled event logging for extensibility
4. **WebSocket via Channels**: Built-in Django integration for real-time features
5. **Zustand for State**: Lightweight alternative to Redux with good performance
6. **React Query**: Centralized server state management and caching

## Security Considerations

- CORS properly configured
- CSRF protection enabled
- SQL injection prevention via ORM
- XSS protection via React
- Secure password hashing
- HTTPS ready (Nginx SSL config template)
- Rate limiting configured
- Security headers in Nginx

## Performance Optimizations

- Database query optimization (select_related, prefetch_related)
- Redis caching layer
- Pagination for large datasets
- React component memoization ready
- Code-splitting support
- Static file compression
- Nginx gzip compression

2. **Production Patterns**: Uses industry best practices (transactions, caching, async tasks)
3. **Scalability**: Ready for growth with Kubernetes, multi-region deployment
4. **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation, testable code, easy setup
5. **DevOps Ready**: Multiple deployment options, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring ready
6. **Real-time Capabilities**: WebSocket support for modern features
7. **Security First**: JWT auth, CORS, rate limiting, secure by default

## Deployment Paths

- **Development**: Docker Compose (all-in-one)
- **Staging**: Single Kubernetes cluster
- **Production**: Multi-region K8s with auto-scaling, CDN, monitoring

---

**Status**: Production-ready with latest technology stack

## Verification Commands

### Local Development

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up

# Start with Kubernetes
kind create cluster --name project-dashboard
docker build -f deployment/docker/Dockerfile.backend -t paulkokos/project-dashboard-backend:latest .

```

### Health Checks
- Backend Health: `GET /api/health/` (HTTP 200)
- Frontend: `GET /` (HTTP 200, serves index.html)
- Database: Connected and migrations applied
- Redis: Connected and operational
- WebSocket: Broadcasting project updates in real-time

### Version Verification
- Backend: `python manage.py --version` (should show Django 5.1.3)
- Frontend: `npm --version` (should show 11.6.2+), `node --version` (should show 22+)
- Python: `python --version` (should show 3.11+)
